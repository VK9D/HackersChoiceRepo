<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



The
<B>gs</B>


tool can be used to enable a programm to communicate trough a firewall in situations were it would not be possible to establish a direct connection to another host/workstation (NATed/firewalled). The typical scenario is two workstations that are on separate private networks and behind separate firewalls. The
<B>gs</B>


tool hijacks the network library functions (such as connect() and accept()) of the programm and encrypts and redirects the traffic through the Global Socket Relay Network (GSRN). 
<P>

Neither workstation needs to open a port in their firewall or accept incoming TCP connections.
<P>

The connection is end-2-end encrypted using SRP (RFC 5054) with AES-256 and a 4096 Prime. The GSRN sees only the encrypted traffic. 
<P>

Common uses include:
<P>

<UL><P>

<LI>

ssh from one workstation to another
<LI>

OpenVPN between two workstations
<LI>

netcat between two workstations
<LI>

and much, much more.
</UL><P>

<P>

<BR>&nbsp;...while&nbsp;both&nbsp;workstations&nbsp;are&nbsp;behind&nbsp;NAT&nbsp;and&nbsp;firewalled.
<P>

Abandon the thinking of IP addresses and port numbers: Two programms should be able to communicate with each other as long as they know the same secret (rather than each others IP address and port number). The
<B>gs</B>


tools establishes a such connection regardless and independent of the local IP address or geographical location. It does so by analyzing the programm and replacing the IP-Layer with its own transport via the GSRN. The connection is End-2-End encrypted. The GSRN sees only the encrypted traffic.
<P>

The typical scenario is a client/server arrangement such as ssh and sshd: All connections to any hostname that end with '.gsocket' are redirected (via the GSRN) to the server on a separate network (as long as both programms use the same secret).
<P>

The redirection is done per programm (and limited to that program only). The
<B>gs</B>


tool does not change the routing table and does not change the NAT or firewall settings.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>-s </B><I>secret</I>




<DD>
A secret chosen by the user. Both ends need to use the same secret to connect.
<DT><B>-k </B><I>file</I>




<DD>
A file containing the secret.
<DT><B>-g</B>


<DD>
Generate a secure random secret and output it to standard output.
<DT><B>-q</B>


<DD>
Quiet mode. Do not output any warnings or errors.
<DT><B>-T</B>


<DD>
Use TOR. The
<B>gs</B>


tool will connect via TOR to the GSRN. This requires TOR to be installed and running.
<DT><B>-p </B><I>port</I>




<DD>
TCP port range of listening ports to redirect [default=all].

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<B>Example 1</B>

- OpenSSH between two firewalled workstations:
<P>

Server:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ gs -s MySecret /usr/sbin/sshd</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Client:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ gs -s MySecret ssh <A HREF="mailto:root@gsocket">root@gsocket</A></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<B>Example 2</B>

- netcat between two firewalled workstations:
<P>

Server:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ gs -s MySecret nc -lp 31337</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Client:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ gs -s MySecret nc gsocket 31337</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<B>Example 3</B>

- OpenVPN between two firewalled workstations:
<P>

Server:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ gs -s MySecret openvpn --dev tun1 --proto tcp-server --ifconfig 10.9.8.1 10.9.8.2</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Client:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ gs -s MySecret openvpn --dev tun1 --proto tcp-client --ifconfig 10.9.8.2 10.9.8.1 --remote gsocket</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

The following environment variables can be set to control the behavior of
<B>gs</B>


<P>

<B>GSOCKET_SOCKS_IP</B>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>Specify the IP address of the TOR server (or any other SOCKS server). Default is 127.0.0.1.</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<B>GSOCKET_SOCKS_PORT</B>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>The port number of the TOR server (or any other SOCKS server). Default is 9050.</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<B>GSOCKET_ARGS</B>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>A string containing additional command line parameters. First the normal command line parameters are processed and then the command line parameters from GSOCKET_ARGS.</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SECURITY</H2>

Passing the password as command line parameter is not secure. Consider using the -k option or GSOCKET_ARGS or enter the password when prompted:
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ gs -k &lt;file&gt;</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ export GSOCKET_ARGS=&quot;-s MySecret&quot;</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ gs</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<B>1.</B>

The security is end-2-end. This means from User-2-User (and not just to the GSRN). The GSRN relays only (encrypted) data to and from the users.
<P>

<B>2.</B>

The session is 256 bit and ephemeral. It is freshly generated for every session and generated randomly (and is not based on the password). It uses OpenSSL's SRP with AES-256 and a 4096 Prime.
<P>

<B>3.</B>

The password can be 'weak' without weakening the security of the session. A brute force attack against a weak password requires a new TCP connection for every guess.
<P>

<B>4.</B>

Do not use stupid passwords like 'password123'. Malice might pick the same (stupid) password by chance and connect. If in doubt use gs-netcat -g to generate a strong one. Alice's and Bob's password should at least be strong enough so that Malice can not guess it by chance while Alice is waiting for Bob to connect.
<P>

<B>5.</B>

If Alice shares the same password with Bob and Charlie and either one of them connects then Alice can not tell if it is Bob or Charlie who connected.
<P>

<B>6.</B>

Assume Alice shares the same password with Bob and Malice. When Alice stops listening for a connection then Malice could start to listen for the connection instead. Bob (when opening a new connection) can not tell if he is connecting to Alice or to Malice. Use -a &lt;token&gt; if you worry about this. TL;DR: When sharing the same password with a group larger than 2 then it is assumed that everyone in that group plays nicely. Otherwise use SSH over the GS/TLS connection.
<P>

<B>7.</B>

SRP has Perfect Forward Secrecy. This means that past sessions can not be decrypted even if the password becomes known.

Efforts have been made to have
<B>gs</B>


&quot;do the right thing&quot; in all its various modes. If you believe that it is doing the wrong thing under whatever circumstances, please notify me (<A HREF="mailto:skyper@thc.org">skyper@thc.org</A>) and tell me how you think it should behave.
